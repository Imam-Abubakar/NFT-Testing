Deployed a NFT project on Ethereum

Smart contract built using Hardhat, Deployed using Alchemy API

Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development. In simple words you can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.

You can think of Alchemy as AWS EC2 for blockchain. It is a node provider. It helps us to connect with the blockchain by providing us with nodes so that we can read and write to the blockchain. Alchemy is what helps us deploy the contract to rinkeby.
